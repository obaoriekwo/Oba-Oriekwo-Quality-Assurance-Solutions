                    <h1>Why we value software quality control</h1>
                    <p> Quality control constitutes one of the  most crucial factors to consider when releasing a new product. 
                        Quality assurance must be put in place before the product is released to the end users so as to compete favourably 
                      in the business and thus avoid being swept away by other competitors. 
            
                      <br> As a quality assurance Engineer/software developer, I assist companies in providing quality assurance and
                     flawless product quality for their valued customers.<br> I am available to participate in 
                     projects ranging from manual testing, Automation testing, front end and backend software development.<br>
                     I can work in a team and also independently depending on the choice of the organisation.
                     The contract can be long term or fixed-term contract.

                        <p><strong>CI/CD</strong></p>
                        <p>Continuous integration enables many  developers to contribute and collaborate in a shared code base at a fast pace.
                        CI is an agile and DevOps best practice, and without CI, developers's collaboration would have been a hell of task as 
                        code changes would have been done manually. Continuous delivery sets in to ensure softwares are produced in short cycles.

                        <p> <strong>SDLC</strong></p>
                        <p> Software development life cycle is another vital aspect that we value. SDLC describes all the stages involved in 
                            creation of a software. These stages are requirement analysis, in-depth planning, product design, coding,
                         testing, deployment and post-production maintenance. This serves as an interative framework to guide the team throughout 
                         all the major deployment stages.

                    <div class="column">
                        <p> <strong>MANUAL  TESTING</strong></p>
                        <p>Manual testing is human intervention based where softwares are tested manually. Manual testing is suitable for all kinds of applications. 
                        It goes a long way in assessing user interfaces (UI) and user experience (UX). Manual testing is economical and accurate and can help in spoting bugs 
                        easily.

                        <p> <strong>AUTOMATION TESTING</strong></p>
                        <p> Automation testing is essential in software development. It helps in raising the effectiveness, test coverage, and  the speed 
                            of execution in software testing. Automation testing is expensive but does not require human intervention since it runs unattended.
                            Is interesting working with different automation tools such as Cypress, Robotframework, Selenium etc</p>

                        <p> <strong>FRONT END DEVELOPMENT</strong></p>
                        <p>The client-side development otherwise known as front-end web development is one aspect that I love so much since it is interwoven
                         with automation testing. I work mainly with HTML,CSS and Javascript to develop websites or web based applications that users 
                         can directly use. Although the tools and techniques used are subject to constant changes, but I have an everlearning mindset
                         to adapt to these changes.

                        <p> <strong>BACK END DEVELOPMENT</strong></p>
                        <p>The server-side development which is also known as back-end. Databases, scripting, website architecture constitutes a great 
                            percentage of the back-end development. Behind the scene activities which happens when performing any action on a website 
                        takes place at the back-end. I prefer working with SQL and Python at the back-end and Linux for administering servers</p>
